## Learn to use git clone as a faster way to initially sync a GitHub repo to your local machine

Use this task as a chance to organise all your Python work into a single folder (Git repo) and use subfolders to organise the Python topics

Push/upload all your Python work to your GitHub repo

Points to note:

Use HTTPS for now, SSH will be introduced later.

Always make a README.md in the ROOT of your repo (Git folder) if you want GitHub to show it automatically when a person goes to your repo

The task
1. Create a blank repo on GitHub named tech264-python (or similar)

2. On your local machine, open a Git Bash window and navigate to the place where you want to keep all your GitHub repos (e.g. C: \Users\RamonRossi\OneDrive\Documents\github)

3. Use the git clone command to sync the empty GitHub repo to the local machine

4. cd into the tech264-python folder (or whatever you named it on GitHub)

5. Copy all your existing python work to this folder

6. Commit and push changes to GitHub for this repo

7. Check that on GitHub, when you go to the repo, you can see all your work now

8. Document
